# Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities
---
## MODULE 1: Introduction to Risk Management

- **Risk**: Anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset.
- **Security Plans**: Based on the analysis of three elements: assets, threats, and vulnerabilities.
- **Asset**: An item perceived as having value to an organization.
- **Threat**: Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.
  - **Intentional Threat**: Example: A malicious hacker targeting a misconfigured application.
  - **Unintentional Threat**: Example: An employee holding the door open for an unknown person.
- **Vulnerability**: A weakness that can be exploited by a threat.
  - **Technical Vulnerability**: Example: Misconfigured software.
  - **Human Vulnerability**: Example: A forgetful employee losing their access card.
- **Risk Calculation**: Helps in:
  - Preventing costly and disruptive events.
  - Identifying improvements to systems and processes.
  - Determining which risks can be tolerated.
  - Prioritizing critical assets that require attention.
- **Asset Management**: Starts with an asset inventory, a catalog of assets that need protection.
- **Asset Classification**: Labeling assets based on sensitivity and importance.
  - **Restricted**: Highest level, for incredibly sensitive assets.
  - **Confidential**: Assets whose disclosure may lead to significant negative impact.
  - **Internal-only**: Assets available to employees and business partners.
  - **Public**: Lowest level, no negative consequences if released.
- **Data**: Information translated, processed, or stored by a computer.
  - **Data in Use**: Data being accessed by users.
  - **Data in Transit**: Data traveling from one point to another.
  - **Data at Rest**: Data not currently being accessed.
- **InfoSec**: Practice of keeping data in all states away from unauthorized users.
- **Risk Categories**: Damage, disclosure, or loss of information.
- **Policy**: Set of rules that reduce risk and protect information.
- **Standards**: References that inform how to set policies.
- **Procedures**: Step-by-step instructions to perform a specific security task.
- **Compliance**: Adhering to internal standards and external regulations.
- **Regulations**: Rules set by a government or other authority.
- **NIST**: Provides frameworks and security standards, including the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

## MODULE 2: Cryptography and Access Controls

- **Cryptography**: Transforming information into a form unintended readers can't understand.
- **Caesar's Cipher**: Simple algorithm shifting letters in the Roman alphabet.
- **Cryptographic Key**: Mechanism that decrypts ciphertext.
- **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**: Encryption framework securing online information exchange.
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses public and private key pairs (e.g., RSA, DSA).
- **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses a single secret key (e.g., 3DES, AES).
- **Hash Function**: Algorithm producing a unique code (hash value) that can't be decrypted.
- **Hash Collision**: Different inputs producing the same hash value.
- **Rainbow Table**: File of pre-generated hash values and their plaintext.
- **Salting**: Adding random characters to data before hashing to strengthen hash functions.
- **Non-repudiation**: Authenticity of information can't be denied.
- **Access Controls**: Security controls managing access, authorization, and accountability.
- **AAA Framework**: Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting.
  - **Authentication**: Verifying identity using factors like knowledge, ownership, and characteristics.
  - **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Combines several logins into one.
  - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Requires two or more verification methods.
- **Authorization Controls**: Linked to separation of duties and least privilege.
- **OAuth**: Open-standard authorization protocol sharing access between applications.
- **API Token**: Encrypted code containing user information.
- **Session**: Sequence of network requests and responses associated with the same user.
- **Session Hijacking**: Attackers obtaining a legitimate user's session ID.
- **Exploit**: Taking advantage of a vulnerability.
- **Vulnerability Management**: Process of finding and patching vulnerabilities.
- **Zero-Day**: Previously unknown exploit.

## MODULE 3: Defense in Depth
- **Defense in Depth**: Layered approach to vulnerability management.
  - **Perimeter Layer**: User authentication.
  - **Network Layer**: Network firewalls.

- **MITRE**: Non-profit research and development centers.
- **CNA**: Organization analyzing and distributing CVE information.
- **CVSS**: Common Vulnerability Scoring System.
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Identifying weak points to prevent attacks.
  - **Steps**: Identification, Vulnerability Analysis, Risk Assessment, Remediation.
- **Scans**:
  - **External Scans**: Test the perimeter layer.
  - **Internal Scans**: Examine internal systems.
  - **Authenticated Scans**: Log in with real user accounts.
  - **Unauthenticated Scans**: Simulate external threat actors.
  - **Limited Scans**: Analyze particular devices.
  - **Comprehensive Scans**: Analyze all devices on a network.
- **Pentest**:
  - **Red Team**: Simulate attacks to identify vulnerabilities.
  - **Blue Team**: Focus on defense and incident response.
  - **Purple Team**: Collaborative, improving security posture.
- **Hacker**: Person using computers to gain unauthorized access.
- **Access Points**:
  - **Direct Access**: Physical access to a system.
  - **Removable Media**: Portable hardware like USB drives.
  - **Social Media**: Platforms for communication and content sharing.
  - **Email**: Personal and business accounts.
  - **Wireless Networks**: On-premises networks.
  - **Cloud Services**: Third-party provided services.
  - **Supply Chains**: Third-party vendors.
- **Attack Vectors**: Pathways attackers use to penetrate defenses.
- **Attacker Mindset**: Identify target, determine access, evaluate vectors, tools, and methods.
- **Defense**: Educating users, applying least privilege, using security controls, building a diverse team.
