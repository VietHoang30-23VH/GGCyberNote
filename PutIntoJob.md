- **Two key skills for escalation**:  
  - Attention to detail  
  - Following an organization's escalation guidelines or processes  
- **Low-level security issues**: Risks that do not expose Personally Identifiable Information (PII).  
- **Malware infection**: An incident where malicious software disrupts a system or network (e.g., ransomware attack).  
- **Unauthorized access**: An incident where an individual gains digital or physical access to a system or application without permission.  
- **Improper usage**: When an employee violates the organization's acceptable use policies (always escalated).

  - Google Sheets: A free alternative for spreadsheet creation and data visualization.  

## **MODULE 5: Job Preparation**
- **Key skills and tools**:  
  - **Python**: Essential programming language for cybersecurity tasks.  
  - **Linux command-line**: Crucial for system administration and security operations.  
  - **Security mindset**: Ability to think like an attacker and anticipate security risks.  
  - **Frameworks and controls**: Knowledge of industry standards (e.g., NIST, ISO 27001).  
  - **SIEM tools**: Security Information and Event Management tools for threat detection and response.
