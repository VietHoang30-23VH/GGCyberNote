# Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks  

## 📌 Module 1: Security Domains  

### 🔥 Security Posture  
An organization's ability to **manage, defend, and respond** to security threats effectively.  

### 📊 Security and Risk Management  
- Define security goals, **risk mitigation**, compliance, and legal regulations.  
- Ensure **business continuity** through disaster recovery plans.  

### ⚠️ Risk Mitigation  
- Implement procedures to **reduce the impact of breaches** and security incidents.  

### 🏢 Business Continuity  
- Maintain operational efficiency by establishing **disaster recovery strategies**.  

### 🔐 Asset Security & Shared Responsibility  
- **Everyone** plays a role in ensuring both **physical** and **cybersecurity**.  

### 🆔 IAM (Identity and Access Management)  
Four key components:  
1. **Identification** – Recognizing users.  
2. **Authentication** – Verifying identities.  
3. **Authorization** – Granting access based on permissions.  
4. **Accountability** – Tracking actions taken by users.  

### 🛡️ Risk Levels in Organizations  
Organizations classify risks as **low, medium, or high**:  

| Risk Level  | Description | Example Assets |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| **Low**     | Public information | Website content, Published research data |
| **Medium**  | Internal data | Employee records, Internal reports |
| **High**    | Critical data | Customer PII, Financial data, Intellectual property |

### 📋 NIST RMF (Risk Management Framework)  
A structured **7-step** risk management process:  

1. **Prepare** – Establish security processes.  
2. **Categorize** – Assess risk levels.  
3. **Select** – Choose appropriate security controls.  
4. **Implement** – Deploy security measures.  
5. **Assess** – Evaluate security effectiveness.  
6. **Authorize** – Approve and take responsibility.  
7. **Monitor** – Continuously track and improve security.

## 📌 Module 2: Security Frameworks and Controls  

### 📜 Security Frameworks  
Frameworks provide structured guidelines to **prevent, detect, and respond** to cyber threats:  

- **ISO/IEC 27001** – International security standards.  
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** – Five key functions:  
  1. **Identify** risks.  
  2. **Protect** assets.  
  3. **Detect** threats.  
  4. **Respond** to incidents.  
  5. **Recover** from attacks.  

### 🔒 Security Controls  
Types of security controls:  
- **Technical** – Firewalls, encryption, authentication.  
- **Physical** – Surveillance, locks, security guards.  
- **Administrative** – Policies, training, risk assessments.  

### ⚖️ CIA Triad  
A fundamental security principle:  
- **Confidentiality** – Protect sensitive data.  
- **Integrity** – Ensure data accuracy and reliability.  
- **Availability** – Ensure system uptime and accessibility.

## 📌 Module 3: Introduction to Cybersecurity Tools  

### 📁 Logs and Monitoring  
Different types of logs track system activities:  

| Log Type  | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Firewall Log** | Tracks network traffic and connection attempts. |
| **Network Log** | Records devices joining and leaving the network. |
| **Server Log** | Tracks server access, errors, and authentication. |

### 🛠️ SIEM Tools  
Security Information and Event Management (**SIEM**) systems collect and analyze security data:  
- **Self-hosted SIEM** – Managed internally (e.g., Splunk Enterprise).  
- **Cloud-hosted SIEM** – Managed externally (e.g., Splunk Cloud, Chronicle).  
- **Hybrid SIEM**
### 📊 Metrics  
Measure key security performance indicators:  
- **Response time**  
- **Availability**  
- **Failure rate**

## 📌 Module 4: Use Playbooks to Respond to Incidents  

### 📘 Playbooks  
Standardized procedures to ensure a **consistent response** to incidents.  

### 🔄 Incident Response Steps  
1. **Preparation** – Set up response plans and assign roles.  
2. **Detection & Analysis** – Identify security threats.  
3. **Containment** – Isolate affected systems.  
4. **Eradication & Recovery** – Remove threats and restore systems.  
5. **Post-Incident Review** – Document and improve responses.  

### ⚡ SIEM and SOAR Integration  
- **SIEM** – Detects and analyzes threats.  
- **SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)** – Automates security workflows to enhance response time.
